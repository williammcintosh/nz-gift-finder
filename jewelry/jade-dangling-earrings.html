        <p class="intro">
          These are pure Aotearoa in a wearable form. Real pounamu, hand carved,
          with that deep green glow that changes as the light hits it. They feel
          grounded and special at the same time, like you are carrying a little
          piece of the South Island with you. No two are the same, so yours end
          up feeling properly yours.

          <p class="body">
            It is the real deal. Genuine West Coast pounamu, hand carved by New
            Zealand artisans, so every piece has its own colour and natural
            markings. The sterling silver hooks keep it simple and clean, and
            the shape sits nicely without feeling heavy. The traceable
            authentication card is a cool touch too, it links the stone back to
            where it came from.

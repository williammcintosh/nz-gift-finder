        <p class="intro">
          These earrings carry that familiar Aotearoa energy people are drawn
          to. Smooth greenstone, hand carved shapes, and a look that feels calm,
          grounded, and intentional. They sit in that space between everyday
          wear and something meaningful, the kind of piece you reach for when
          you want to feel connected to nature and culture at the same time.

          <div class="kicker">Why this one works</div>
          <p class="body">
            The design takes clear inspiration from Maori carving traditions,
            with flowing lines and symbolic shapes that feel timeless. These are
            made from genuine nephrite jade, not New Zealand pounamu, but they
            still capture the look and spirit people associate with greenstone
            from Aotearoa. Each pair has its own colour shifts and markings, so
            no two feel identical, which is part of the appeal.

        <p class="intro">
          This cleanser is a staple in heaps of New Zealand bathrooms. Created
          by Sonya Driver, founder of the Eco Tan brand, it fits right into that
          laid back, outdoorsy lifestyle we live here. Gentle, fresh, and easy
          to use, it feels good after a long day in the sun, wind, or salt air.
          Simple skincare that actually suits real life in Aotearoa.

          <p class="body">
            It matches the New Zealand way of doing skincare. Clean, gentle, and
            not overthought. Aloe keeps skin calm, citrus keeps it feeling
            fresh, and the gel texture rinses off easily. It is the kind of
            cleanser people stick with because it just fits into everyday life.
